Howard Michael Bard, the son of Ileen F. Bard and Alvin L. Bard of Baltimore, was married June 25 to Christopher Speron, a son of the late Maria G. Speron and the late Socrates J. Speron, formerly of Lake Grove, N.Y. The Rev. George B. Walker Jr., a minister of the United Church of Christ, officiated at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. Rabbi Laurie Green led the signing of the Jewish marriage contract.
The couple met in 1987 at George Washington University, from which they graduated and where Mr. Bard received a law degree and Mr. Speron received a master’s degree in public administration.
Mr. Bard (left), 52, is a vice president for taxes and retirement security for the American Council of Life Insurers, a trade association for the life insurance industry in Washington, where he guides policy on retirement-related regulations and legislation.
Mr. Speron, 46, is the vice president for development at the Human Rights Campaign, a Washington-based L.G.B.T. advocacy group, where he is responsible for fund-raising.
At the ceremony, Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court case that recognized the right of same-sex couples to marry, read an excerpt from the court decision.
The couple chose their wedding date in commemoration of the one-year anniversary of the court’s historic decision, which, Mr. Speron said, “was such an important moment for the L.G.B.T.Q. community as well as for us personally. What better weekend is there to get married on.”
