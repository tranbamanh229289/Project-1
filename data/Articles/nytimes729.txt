England striker Jamie Vardy agreed to stay with Leicester City on Thursday, turning down a chance to move to Arsenal in order to lead the Foxes in their Premier League title defense and first Champions League campaign.
Leicester City announced that Vardy, who led the team with 24 goals last season, had agreed to extend his contract by four years.
Arsenal activated Vardy’s release clause before the European Championships, but he had been silent publicly regarding his future while playing for England. Vardy, 29, has not signed the new deal, but Leicester’s statement left little doubt that he had recommitted to the team.
“Both parties hope that this announcement will end recent speculation regarding Jamie’s future and confirm his long-term commitment to Leicester City,” Leicester said in a statement.
After finishing second in Group B, England plays Iceland in the round of 16 on Monday. Vardy scored one goal in the tournament’s group stage. (AP)
