LONDON — Bank of America Merrill Lynch has hired a former executive at the investment banking firm Greenhill & Company as head of its mergers and acquisitions business for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Luca Ferrari, a former co-chief of Greenhill's European corporate advisory business, is expected to join Bank of America Merrill Lynch in July and will be based in London, according to an internal memorandum on Thursday reviewed by The New York Times.
“In this role, Luca will leverage his deep expertise and network to drive the growth of our M.&A. franchise across the region,” Jack MacDonald, Adrian Mee and Patrick Ramsey, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's co-heads of global mergers and acquisitions, and Luigi Rizzo, head of investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in the memo.
Mr. Ferrari has more than 25 years of experience in the mergers and acquisitions business, working previously at Goldman Sachs and UBS before he joined Greenhill in 2012. Mr. Ferrari left Greenhill in October.
