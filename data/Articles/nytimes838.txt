CHICAGO — The reigning Copa América champion, Chile, overcame a severe storm, a lengthy delay and a battling Colombian team to advance to the Copa Centenario final with a 2-0 win on Wednesday night at Soldier Field. Goals from Charles Aránguiz and José Pedro Fuenzalida in the first 11 minutes iced the match.
Strong thunderstorms and a tornado warning forced a delay of two and a half hours at halftime, and the storms left the field nearly unplayable. The crowd was evacuated by stadium security personnel as lightning crashed around the city. Standing water was squeegeed off by the grounds crew to allow play to resume. Weather delays are rare in Chicago; the last game that was stopped at Soldier Field for storms was a Bears game in November 2013.
With the win, Chile set up a rematch of last year’s Copa América final against Argentina that will be played Sunday in East Rutherford, N.J. Colombia will face the United States in a third-place game on Saturday in Glendale, Ariz.
Colombia was reduced to 10 men in the second half when Carlos Sánchez collected his second yellow card.
