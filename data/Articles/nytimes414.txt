There’s a part of us that delights in watching seemingly perfect things be mussed up, taken down or wickedly exposed. Ballet is an art form that often wraps itself in purity and propriety, but there’s pleasure in occasionally watching it get nasty, as it did in the 2010 film “Black Swan” and last year’s TV series “Flesh and Bone.”
This week, Jack Ferver contributes a new work to the growing canon of sexy ballet horror stories with “I Want You to Want Me,” a gothic fairy tale about a young American ballerina who joins a European dance company and lands in a nightmare. Mr. Ferver’s dance-theater works are campy, clever and refreshingly unhinged; here he mixes in some rigorous ballet choreography — he calls it “post-Balanchine witch” — performed by Reid Bartelme, Barton Cowperthwaite and Carling Talcott-Steenstra. Mr. Ferver, also appearing as Madame M., claims to be a populist, but subversion is really his game. (The Kitchen, americandance.org/nyc.)
