PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona has eliminated its use of the sedative midazolam as one of the drugs it relies on in carrying out executions.
Lawyers for the state said in a court filing on Friday that its current supply of midazolam expired on May 31, and that Arizona's sources for the drug have dried up because of pressure from opponents of the death penalty.
That leaves Arizona with other lethal-drug combinations, but the state's lawyers said it cannot currently carry out executions because it has no access to supplies of pentobarbital and sodium thiopental.
The status of the drug supplies was revealed Friday in a court filing connected to a suit over Arizona's application of the death penalty.
Executions in Arizona were put on hold after the July 2014 death of a convicted killer, Joseph Rudolph Wood, who was given 15 doses of midazolam and a painkiller and took nearly two hours to die. His lawyer in the lawsuit says the execution was botched.
A ruling last month by Federal District Judge Neil Wake dismissed parts of the lawsuit, but other elements of the case remain in play.
The state argued in its filing on Friday that the lawsuit is moot now that midazolam is off the table.
States are struggling to obtain execution drugs because European pharmaceutical companies began blocking the use of their products for lethal injections.
Capital-punishment states refuse to disclose the sources of their drugs, though they are widely believed to come from compounding pharmacies — organizations that make drugs tailored to the needs of a specific client.
Those pharmacies do not face the same approval process or testing standards as larger pharmaceutical companies.
