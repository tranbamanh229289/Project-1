Velcro, hiking sandals, nylon straps and cycling shorts aren’t details typically associated with tailored men’s wear. But on many of the spring/summer 2017 men’s runways this week in Milan, designers have shown utilitarian, outdoorsy takes on suiting. At Prada, Miuccia Prada riffed on the idea of the global nomad, with even formal looks paired with oversize camping bags. At Marni, classic men’s shirts and suits came complete with velcro adjustments, which enable the wearer to alter the fit and silhouette. And at Versace, tailored looks were paired with Teva-like sandals and pieces from the new Versace Active performance line — such as a topcoat, which was worn over a biker top and shorts. Because, why not?
