Some interesting opera may be ahead for New York. Pierre Audi, who recently became the artistic director of the Park Avenue Armory, has been named the next director of the Aix-en-Provence Festival in southern France, the festival announced on Friday.
Mr. Audi, a stage director and impresario known for fostering contemporary work and for projects of daunting ambition, has led the Dutch National Opera for three decades. But he'll give up Amsterdam for Aix in 2018. In a telephone interview, he suggested his taste for collaboration may facilitate cross-Atlantic cooperation.
“They're two sides of me,” he said of his positions in Aix (where the 2019 festival will be the first wholly planned by him) and New York. “But I don't exclude that there will be connections.”
Any sharing would be tantalizing: Aix is one of the world's best opera immersions and one of the most progressive. The last time I was there, in 2012, one production, an enigmatic multimedia rumination on Huey Newton and the Black Panthers, sprawled through a park in a public housing complex.
This year brings a new production of Debussy's “Pelléas et Mélisande,” conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen, directed by Katie Mitchell and starring Barbara Hannigan, singing her first Mélisande in a staging that imagines the opera as that character's fever dream. There are also new takes on “Così Fan Tutte” (Aix traditionally has a Mozart), Handel's “Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno” (ditto a Baroque piece) and the premiere of “Kalila wa Dimna,” in French and Arabic.
“Internationalism is our salvation,” Mr. Audi said, noting that the festival's announcement came just a few hours after Britain voted to leave the European Union. “I'm touched that on this very day I've accepted such a very cosmopolitan, compassionate festival as Aix.”
