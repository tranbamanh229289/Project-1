A New Hampshire woman who sued Bill Cosby for defamation has voluntarily dismissed her lawsuit against the entertainer.
The woman, Kristina Ruehli, filed for dismissal on Friday in United States District Court in Massachusetts, a day after Judge Mark G. Mastroianni ruled against Mr. Cosby’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
Ms. Ruehli, 72, accused Mr. Cosby in 2014 of drugging and sexually assaulting her in 1965. She filed her lawsuit against Mr. Cosby last November, saying that he branded her a liar after she came forward.
“We accomplished what we wanted to do,” Ms. Ruehli said in an interview, alluding to the fact that she had helped to bring more attention to the accusations against Mr. Cosby. “I simply want to wash my hands of this,” she added.
Ms. Ruehli said she had spent more than $80,000 in legal fees.
Mr. Cosby’s lawyers said in a statement that they “hope and expect” more lawsuits will be dismissed, and that they “look forward to fighting any that are not dismissed, before a jury of our peers.”
The lawsuit is one of several that have been filed against Mr. Cosby since November 2014. He still faces a separate defamation suit in Massachusetts that was filed by seven women. A judge in Pennsylvania dismissed another defamation lawsuit against Mr. Cosby earlier this year.
Mr. Cosby, 78, also faces a criminal case in Pennsylvania, where prosecutors say he sexually assaulted a young woman in his home in 2004. A habeas corpus hearing in that case is scheduled for July 7, and Mr. Cosby is expected to attend.
Mr. Cosby, who has been accused by dozens of women of sexual assault, has denied the allegations against him.
