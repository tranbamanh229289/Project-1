Last week, the magazine Science published a thought-provoking article about what sort of morality people would like their self-driving cars to have.
In theory, people want machines that would try to save the greatest number of people in an accident. In practice, however, that noble sentiment might take a back seat to self-preservation, respondents to a series of surveys seemed to indicate.
If you are the programmer of the software that runs autonomous vehicles, do you have to make the decision about who lives or dies?
Now, a commentary in The New York Times’s Sunday Review asks a related and provocative question: Does artificial intelligence have a “white guy problem”? The piece, written by Kate Crawford, a principal researcher at Microsoft and co-chairwoman of a White House symposium on society and A.I., points out a number of embarrassing instances in which A.I. programs have made mistakes that if they were made by humans would be obvious examples of racism.
It is not clear why these mistakes have happened, but they do serve as a warning that the tech industry will need to scrutinize the digital brains it is creating. As Ms. Crawford writes, “inclusivity matters — from who designs it to who sits on the company boards and which ethical perspectives are included. Otherwise, we risk constructing machine intelligence that mirrors a narrow and privileged vision of society, with its old, familiar biases and stereotypes.”
