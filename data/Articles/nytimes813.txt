Donald J. Trump put his finger firmly on the reset button on Wednesday, with a speech that savaged Hillary Clinton as untrustworthy, “corrupt” and out only for herself. It was Mr. Trump’s best day since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee in May.
Whether he can hold the momentum remains to be seen. He will leave for a trip to Scotland on Thursday night, a two-day jaunt centered on his golf courses. Such trips pose risks for any candidate, but particularly one moored to a private enterprise rather than to burnishing foreign policy credentials, particularly at a moment of deep political tumult in Britain.
Mr. Trump, however, is said to view the trip as an opportunity to refresh himself and his candidacy after a brutal few weeks.
Mrs. Clinton’s campaign fought to minimize any traction Mr. Trump could gain from his speech. Her campaign announced an endorsement from Brent Scowcroft, a former national security adviser to two Republican presidents, which is unsurprising given that much of the foreign policy establishment opposes Mr. Trump. But the endorsement allowed her to push back on the rougher aspects of Mr. Trump’s speech about her time as secretary of state.
Mrs. Clinton’s advisers continue to believe the issue set will favor them in the fall over Mr. Trump, even if he does string together some good days. Mr. Trump has repeatedly emphasized his support from the National Rifle Association, a contrast as congressional Democrats staged a sit-in on the House floor to demand gun control measures in the wake of the shooting in Orlando, Fla. Background checks for gun purchasers, for instance, are popular with a majority of voters nationally.
Mrs. Clinton has real vulnerabilities. But Mr. Trump has only just now started exploiting them, and her allies hope it comes after he has done the most damage to himself.
