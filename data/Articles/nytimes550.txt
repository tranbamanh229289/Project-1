The New York Asian Film Festival, which runs through July 9, always casts a commendably wide net, and this year’s slate has coming-of-age stories, thrillers and romantic comedies. There is horror, too, including the latest from Kiyoshi Kurosawa, whose aptly titled “Creepy” has its premiere on Wednesday, June 29, at Lincoln Center’s Walter Reade Theater.
Hidetoshi Nishijima plays Takakura, a detective who, in a jarring opening scene, has a serial killer in custody when the interrogation goes horribly awry. A year later, Takakura has left the force and is teaching at a college, but he can’t resist poking around in an old missing-persons case. As he is drawn into that, his wife (Yuko Takeuchi) is trying to get to know some unwelcoming new neighbors. The film recalls Mr. Kurosawa’s early work, which is classic fare for a midnight audience, but this screening is at 6 p.m.
