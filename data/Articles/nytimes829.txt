Squared-off, strong-shouldered jackets have been all over the runways this season. First, they showed up in Gosha Rubchinskiy’s grown-up collection in Florence — a sort of homage to American Gigolo-era suits — and made up the bulk of Demna Gvasalia’s debut Balenciaga men’s show in Paris, where the silhouette was further exaggerated with narrow bottoms. Elsewhere, in Milan, we saw Dolce & Gabbana reinterpret its classic suiting with a ’50s jazz influence, as in this oversize double-breasted jacket and cropped trousers. The look teeters somewhere between “Stop Making Sense”-era David Byrne and Uncle Fester Addams — not one for everyone, to say the least.
