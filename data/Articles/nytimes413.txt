The summer-camp horror genre, so familiar to moviegoers, gets a hair-raising television incarnation in “Dead of Summer,” a series that starts Tuesday, June 28, on Freeform. It’s 1989, and Camp Stillwater looks lovely as the young counselors (one of them played by Zelda Williams, Robin’s daughter) arrive to get ready for the season. Most were campers there themselves as children, but there’s also a newbie, Amy (Elizabeth Lail), who is somewhat skittish for reasons that are doled out slowly.
In summer-camp tradition, it’s the newbie who gets sent into the dark forest for more wood at the first campfire gathering. Does the camp have a creepy gardener who scares the bejeebbers out of her while she’s gathering twigs? Of course. But he’s only one potential source of the disquieting things that begin happening. And there are plenty. There’s a reason this show held its premiere party at a Hollywood cemetery.
