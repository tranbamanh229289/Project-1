Bedeviled by dwindling attendance and criticism from fans about their ticketing policies, the Yankees are entering into a partnership with StubHub, a longtime nemesis, to take over the Yankees Ticket Exchange from Ticketmaster, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.
Details were to be released Monday at a news conference. The agreement will begin immediately and run through the 2022 season, according to people close to the negotiations. Sources close to the deal requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about it.
The Yankees have long accused StubHub, a nationwide ticket-resale broker, of undercutting the value of their tickets by making cheap tickets available on the secondary market. The Yankees, in turn, have been accused of making their tickets too expensive.
With the Yankees scuffling, average attendance has fallen to over 8,000 below their mark for 2010, when the Yankees were defending champions.
Beyond feeling uninspired by the Yankees' play, some fans have been angered by their ticket policies. The team's decision this season to enact mobile ticketing and do away with print-at-home tickets was seen as a shot at StubHub.
The ban on print-at-home tickets made it more cumbersome to buy tickets through StubHub and forced some fans who had trouble with mobile ticketing to wait in lines to resolve their problems. Now, it seems, the Yankees have turned to an old foe for help. BILLY WITZ
