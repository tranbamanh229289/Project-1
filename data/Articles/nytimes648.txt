One of the groups that is urging Republicans to dump Donald J. Trump at their convention next month will start showing a new ad that tells delegates to follow their conscience and vote for someone else.
The campaign, which will be focused mainly on Fox and Fox News and cost about $70,000, is part of an effort by anti-Trump forces to raise awareness of their efforts before the convention begins in Cleveland in less than four weeks.
They face an uphill climb. Mr. Trump is so far guaranteed more than 1,500 delegate votes, which gives him more than the majority he needs to secure the nomination. But groups like the one behind the new ad, Delegates Unbound, are arguing that under the proper interpretation of Republican Party rules, delegates are free to vote however they see fit.
“G.O.P. delegates: Choose your values, vote your conscience,” the ad implores as it juxtaposes unflattering clips of Mr. Trump that make him seem foul-mouthed and erratic with clips of Ronald Reagan.
“Our goal is simple, to ensure the delegates are not misled to believe they must follow orders or rules set by others,” said Eric O'Keefe, founder of Delegates Unbound.
The Republican National Committee disagrees and has said that groups like Delegates Unbound are the ones doing the misleading.
