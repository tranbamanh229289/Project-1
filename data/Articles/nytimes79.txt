President Obama will appear next week with Hillary Clinton, the 2016 campaigning debut for the figure expected to be Mrs. Clinton's most potent surrogate in the fall.
The two are scheduled to be in Charlotte, N.C., on Tuesday for what the Clinton campaign described as a discussion of “building on the progress we've made.”
Mr. Obama had been scheduled to campaign with the presumptive Democratic nominee in Wisconsin two weeks ago, but the event was canceled after the nightclub massacre in Orlando, Fla.
In a video this month endorsing Mrs. Clinton, his former Democratic presidential rival and secretary of state, Mr. Obama said he did not think a candidate had ever been so qualified for the office.
“I know how hard this job can be,” he said. “That's why I know Hillary will be so good at it.”
The location of the rally is notable. Clinton aides view North Carolina as a potential opportunity to expand on Mr. Obama's 2012 electoral map. He lost the state four years ago, after winning it in 2008.
