Hillary Clinton savaged Donald J. Trump in a speech on Tuesday that focused on his central campaign strength, the economy. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump will offer his response.
Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, will try to shape an argument against Mrs. Clinton as a fatally flawed candidate, with her own baggage from her tenure at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation.
Mr. Trump's aides had planned for him to give this speech on June 13, but they delayed it after the deadly shootings in Orlando, Fla., a day earlier. The idea, according to people familiar with early versions of the speech, was to keep the focus on the controversy over her use of a private email server at the State Department, a report about her push to put a donor on a sensitive government board, and money her husband earned from a contract with a for-profit college.
For weeks, Republicans have fretted that these are target-rich opportunities with Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, opportunities that Mr. Trump sacrificed as he mired himself in controversies of his own making.
The speech presents Mr. Trump with a chance to keep the spotlight trained on his rival, instead of turning it on himself.
For her part, Mrs. Clinton will meet with House Democrats on Wednesday, as congressional leadership in her party sees a chance to pick up seats if Mr. Trump proves to be a drag on Republican candidates. The meeting highlights contrasts with Mr. Trump's difficulties in his own party, as Republican congressional leaders have denounced him over the last few weeks.
