SEOUL, South Korea â€” A South Korean court issued an arrest warrant on Friday for a Volkswagen executive in connection with the company's cheating on vehicle emissions tests, in another blow to the German automaker's efforts to move on from the scandal.
The warrant is the first to be leveled against a Volkswagen executive after the company in September admitted using software to falsify pollution test results on some diesel cars, spurring legal action in the United States, Germany, South Korea and elsewhere.
Volkswagen has admitted that 11 million of its vehicles worldwide were equipped with software designed to cheat on emissions tests. The automaker said in April that it would set aside $18 billion to cover costs from the scandal.
The South Korean prosecutor's office said that the investigation was continuing and that it would cooperate with counterparts in Germany and the United States.
The Volkswagen Korea executive, identified by his last name, Yun, faces five accusations, including fabrication of documents and violation of the Air Quality Preservation Law, Shin Jae-hwan, a spokesman for the Seoul Central District Court, said.
A Volkswagen Korea spokeswoman declined to comment.
South Korea has taken a particularly hard line against the automaker, filing a criminal complaint against two other executives, fining it 14.1 billion won, or $11.97 million, and ordering it to recall 125,522 vehicles.
About 4,400 Korean consumers have filed a class-action lawsuit against Volkswagen and its Audi brand, demanding compensation over the false emissions claims.
The arrest warrant comes after German prosecutors said on Monday that they were investigating Volkswagen's former chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, and another executive over whether they effectively manipulated markets by delaying the release of information about the cheating.
