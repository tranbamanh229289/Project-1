INTERNATIONAL
The Memo From France article on May 23, about the soul-searching that followed the resignation of the French National Assembly’s vice president, Denis Baupin, after several female colleagues claimed sexual harassment, quoted incorrectly, in some editions, from an essay by 16 prominent Frenchwomen in the newspaper Journal du Dimanche. They wrote, “Omertà and the law of silence are no longer possible” (not “are longer possible”).
•
An article on May 23 about Ecuador’s appointment of Africa Berdonces as the new director of the Galápagos National Park and Marine Reserve misstated part of the name of a threatened species of bird native to the islands. It is the flightless cormorant, not the flightless albatross.
•
A reporting credit on May 22 with an article about the United States’ opportunities for a partnership with Vietnam as President Obama prepared to visit misstated, in some editions, the location of one of the reporters. David E. Sanger reported from Naypyidaw, Myanmar — not from Washington.
NATIONAL
An article on Tuesday about the Senate’s rejection of four measures intended to control gun safety misstated the focus of an amendment offered by Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. His measure sought to tighten background checks for all gun buyers, not just for gun buyers at gun shows and on the internet.
•
An article on Sunday about the redevelopment of downtown Phoenix misstated the reason that the Songbird coffee shop relocated. The owners had a disagreement with the landlord; the store was not displaced by redevelopment.
•
An article on Saturday about NASA’s plans for an electric plane misstated the middle name of a 19th century physicist for whom the plane was named. He was James Clerk Maxwell (not Clark).
NEW YORK
An article on Monday about a yearbook project dedicated to young victims of gun violence misidentified, in some editions, a mother who finds comfort from the smell of a shirt that belonged to her son, who was shot to death in 2012. She is Natasha Christopher — not Shenee Johnson, another mother working on the project, whose son also died in a shooting.
•
An article on May 29 about a funding crisis at the City University of New York described imprecisely the makeup of the Professional Staff Congress, the system’s largest union, which was in contract talks at the time. While it represents 25,000 faculty members and employees, not all of them belong to the union.
•
An article on Friday about efforts by the family of Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen to move his body to Illinois as part of the drive toward his canonization misstated the academic rank of Matthew Sutton, who spoke about the importance of where saints’ remains are kept. He is an associate professor of theology at St. John’s University, not an assistant professor.
OBITUARIES
A picture caption on Sunday with an obituary about the writer Michelle Cliff omitted credit for the photograph of Ms. Cliff. It was taken by Noel Furie.
