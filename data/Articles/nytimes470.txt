A 4-year-old boy was fatally shot by his 6-year-old brother in East Orange, N.J., on Saturday, the authorities said.
The older boy was playing with his mother’s gun at the family’s third-floor apartment on Norman Street when he accidentally shot his brother in the head shortly after 11 a.m., Connie Jackson, a city spokeswoman, said.
The younger boy died at around 4:25 p.m. at University Hospital in Newark, Stacie Newton, a hospital spokeswoman, said.
No charges had been filed as of Saturday afternoon, but the case was being investigated by the police and the state child welfare agency, Ms. Jackson said.
The authorities did not release any of the family members’ names. “This is a terribly unfortunate incident,” said Mayor Lester E. Taylor III of East Orange, adding of the boy: “Our thoughts are with him and his family.”
Ms. Jackson said she did not know whether the family had a history with the child welfare agency, the Division of Child Protection and Permanency, or whether the gun was legally owned.
