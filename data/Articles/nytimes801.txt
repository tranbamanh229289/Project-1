United States stocks made their biggest gain in a month on Thursday as investors grew more optimistic that Britons would vote to stay in the European Union.
Investors bought stocks and sold bonds, sending bond yields and bank stocks higher.
On the day of the British referendum, bank stocks did the best, while materials companies also rose. The price of oil topped $50 a barrel. Utility companies, which are generally seen as a safe investment, lagged the market as investors took more risks.
Throughout the year, the market has bobbed up and down as investors traded on political and central bank news, like the British referendum and comments from the Federal Reserve.
J. J. Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade, said that was because the global economy was sluggish. Corporate profits and revenue have also been uninspiring.
“What it really shows is just a lack of growth,” he said. “That makes it very difficult to commit capital and I think that’s a pattern you’re going to continue to see.”
United States stocks have advanced about 2 percent this week. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 27.87 points, about 1.3 percent, to 2,113.32. The Nasdaq composite climbed 76.72 points, or 1.6 percent, to 4,910.04.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 230.24 points, or 1.3 percent, to 18,011.07.
European stock indexes also advanced. The CAC 40 in France rose 2 percent and the German DAX gained 1.8 percent. The British FTSE 100 rose 1.2 percent.
Bond prices declined, sending the yield of the 10-year Treasury note to 1.74 percent from 1.69 percent a day earlier.
Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make money on lending. Citigroup rose $1.78, or 4.2 percent, to $44.46; Bank of America gained 43 cents, or 3.2 percent, closing at $14.04.
The British pound rose to $1.4879 from $1.4692. The dollar rose to 105.92 yen from 104.48 yen. The euro rose to $1.1379 from $1.1299.
United States crude rose 98 cents, or 2 percent, to $50.11 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, rose $1.03, or 2.1 percent, to $50.91 a barrel in London.
The Labor Department said applications for unemployment benefits fell last week, more evidence that employers are keeping workers and may be hiring at a faster pace. About 2.1 million Americans are receiving those benefits, or 4.6 percent fewer than a year ago.
Gold fell $6.80, to $1,261.20 an ounce. Silver rose 4 cents, to $17.35 an ounce.
