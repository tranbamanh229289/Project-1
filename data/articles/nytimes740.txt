“An American in Paris,” a stylish and balletic musical adaptation of the classic film, will close on Broadway on Jan. 1, the show's producers said Thursday.
The musical, which brought the celebrated ballet choreographer Christopher Wheeldon to Broadway for his directing debut, performed strongly for months, often grossing more than $1 million a week. But its box office has softened this year, and last week it grossed $696,523.
The show began performances in March 2015, and will have had 29 previews and 719 regular performances at the time of its closing. The musical was capitalized for up to $11.5 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission; the producers — Stuart Oken, Van Kaplan and Roy Furman — said they expected that it will recoup before closing.
“American in Paris,” featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin, was nominated for 12 Tony Awards and won four, for Mr. Wheeldon's choreography and for its orchestrations, set design and lighting design.
It is planning a national tour, beginning in Boston in October; a London production is scheduled next year that will feature the original Broadway stars, Robert Fairchild and Leanne Cope.
