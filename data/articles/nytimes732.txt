Juan Carlos Osorio will keep his job as Mexico's coach despite a 7-0 thrashing by Chile last week in the quarterfinals of the Copa América Centenario, according to a top Mexican federation official.
Osorio survived because of his work guiding the national team to nine wins and a draw before Saturday's humiliating loss in Santa Clara, Calif.
“What happened Saturday was a blow to all of us in Mexico,” said Guillermo Cantú, the secretary general of Mexico's soccer federation. “To remove him may be the simplest solution, but we decided to continue with the project started last October.”
Cantú acknowledged that Mexico's participation in the Copa América “was a failure” because, aside from the nature of the team's elimination, it failed to reach Osorio's goal of a semifinal berth. Cantú insisted, however, that Mexico had no desire to return to the days of regular hirings and firings of national team coaches. In the last decade, 12 men have held the job.
