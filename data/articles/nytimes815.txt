President Obama heads to the West Coast on Thursday for the seventh-annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit meeting to discuss ways of linking businesses around the world in new ways, just days after announcing a new $70 million manufacturing grant to a group in Los Angeles.
He may grab more headlines with his Friday conversation with the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg when the two have a chance to discuss the latest social media apps and other hot topics. Mr. Obama's administration has embraced Facebook and Twitter as new ways of communicating in a modern democracy.
Some contentious issues could also come up. The president and his administration have riled some in Silicon Valley by pressing for access to devices like the iPhone during criminal and terrorism investigations. A back-and-forth between Mr. Obama and Mr. Zuckerberg on privacy and encryption would be interesting.
After the summit meeting, Mr. Obama will head to Seattle, where he will help raise money for Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. He is scheduled to return to Washington on Saturday.
