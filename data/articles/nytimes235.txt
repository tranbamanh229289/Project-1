Good morning.
We're trying something new this week: California Today, a morning update for our California readers. Tell us what you'd like to see: CAtoday@nytimes.com
Across California, public transit agencies are pushing ballot measures in search of money for just about everything related to transit: new rail lines, highway widening and even pothole filling.
Santa Clara County will vote in November on a half-cent sales tax to finance transportation projects.
Similar measures will be on the ballot in Sacramento County and, very likely, San Diego County. Possibly several other Bay Area counties as well.
Los Angeles County decided last week to put a half-cent tax on the ballot for the third time in just eight years.
These small sales tax increases have become perhaps the only realistic way to pay for ambitious transportation projects, said Brian D. Taylor, a professor of urban planning at U.C.L.A.
“Voters and elected officials have become very hostile to increases in fuel taxes,” he said.
In 2008, voters in Los Angeles approved a half-cent sales tax increase for 30 years. That has financed projects like the long-awaited rail line connecting downtown to the beach, which just opened.
(Never mind that the trip is often still faster by car.)
Four years later, voters rejected a plan to extend that Los Angeles County sales tax another 30 years.
Now we're headed to the ballot box again — only this time, the sales tax hike would be permanent.

You know this bear.
It flies on the state flag, and dances on the sideline at U.C.L.A. football games.
But how well, exactly, do you want to know this bear? (Especially if you've seen the scene of Leonardo DiCaprio attacked by one in “The Revenant.”)
In fact, the last California grizzly bear was killed nearly 100 years ago.
Now, the Center for Biological Diversity wants to bring the bears back to the California.
Grizzly bears are endangered. In the continental United States, they live only in Yellowstone National Park and a few other remote locations.
The bears, the group said, would not be running around downtown San Francisco.
They could be safely reintroduced in the remote Sierra Nevada.
On its website, the group describes grizzlies as eating mostly nuts, berries, fish and small animals, and only “the occasional person who pokes a camera in their face.”
(Not exactly reassuring.)
This past week, a black bear, known as a skittish animal, clawed its way into a tent and scratched a man who was camping about 30 miles from Los Angeles.
Grizzlies are far larger and more aggressive than black bears.
For now, federal and state officials, convinced that a 1,100-pound grizzly bear would eventually end up in a campground, have not yet shown interest in bringing them back.
California Today is a weekday roundup that stays live from 6 a.m. Pacific time until late morning.
