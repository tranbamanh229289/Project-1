Days after suspending the laboratory that was supposed to handle drug testing at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, the World Anti-Doping Agency, the global regulator of drugs in sports, announced Tuesday that it had suspended Kazakhstan's antidoping lab as well.
It was the sixth suspension announced by WADA in the past three months, a period of unprecedented disciplinary action taken by the agency against antidoping facilities. The agency attributed the sudden uptick to stricter review processes and an attitude of heightened vigilance in the wake of dramatic allegations of widespread doping in Russia.
As with the Rio lab and others, WADA did not specify why Kazakhstan's antidoping facility had been suspended. The lab has 21 days to contest WADA's decision by filing an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland.
In the interim, the lab is prohibited from analyzing urine and blood samples; athletes' samples from the region will be rerouted to other WADA-accredited testing facilities, some 28 of which are in good standing.
In recent months, WADA has disciplined more labs than it has in the past several years combined. In addition to the Rio lab suspension — which complicates the logistics of certifying that this year's Olympians are clean — facilities from Beijing to Bloemfontein, South Africa, have been forbidden to conduct testing.
Last fall, WADA published a report detailing a government-run doping program in Russia that had operated with the cooperation of Russia's WADA-approved antidoping lab. WADA has been criticized for taking years to respond to whistle-blower tips about Russia, and for allowing Russia's lab to lead testing at the 2014 Olympics in spite of suspicious test results, documenting urine with the clear presence of steroids as clean.
“The decision to suspend the laboratory is a direct result of the more stringent quality assessment procedures,” WADA said Tuesday in a statement about the Kazakhstan lab.
