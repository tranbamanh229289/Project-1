TRIPOLI, Libya — At least 34 Libyan pro-government fighters were killed on Tuesday and 100 wounded in clashes with Islamic State militants as they continued their assault on the ISIS stronghold of Surt, Libya.
It was one of bloodiest days since forces loyal to the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord began an offensive in May to retake Surt.
The fighting came as 29 people were killed and dozens wounded further west in the town of Garabulli, near the Libyan capital, when a blast ripped through an arms depot after militiamen and armed residents clashed.
The fall of Surt would be a major blow to the Islamic State, which has faced a series of setbacks in Syria and Iraq.
A statement by the Government of National Accord said Tuesday's fighting took place in several parts of Surt, where militants are pinned down in pockets of the coastal city.
Islamic State fighters “are besieged in a small area of Surt and although they have sought to break out our forces have repelled all attempts,” the statement said.
Around 200 loyalist troops have been killed and hundreds wounded since the start of the offensive to capture Surt, which is 280 miles east of Tripoli.
