The Supreme Court's split-decision ruling blocks President Obama's executive actions delaying the deportations of undocumented immigrants and will have repercussions in the 2016 presidential race that could be felt through to Election Day.
The decision was a political loss for Mr. Obama, for whom immigration overhaul has been a signature legacy item. The subject of illegal immigration helped propel Donald J. Trump through his insurgent candidacy in the Republican primaries. Hillary Clinton used the issue, and the protection of undocumented immigrants, to similarly propel her in the Democrats' primaries.
Both sides of the debate saw potential political gains in the outcome. But Democrats suggested the issue gives Mrs. Clinton a strong contrast to present against Mr. Trump, who has vowed mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and pledged to build a wall along the border with Mexico. Hispanic voters are a crucial part of the emerging Democratic coalition, and Republicans have worried for years about turning off an important portion of voters.
Mr. Obama said that he was frustrated at the ruling and that it was a byproduct of Washington dysfunction that Republicans in the Senate have blocked his Supreme Court nominee, Merrick B. Garland, to replace Antonin Scalia.
Democrats will also make that case heading into the fall as Republicans fight to hold their Senate majority amid a political climate that, at the moment, does not favor them.
