A late winning goal. A spot in the knockout stage. It just does not get better for tiny Iceland.
Delivering the feel-good story of the European Championships, Iceland, the smallest nation ever to compete at the tournament, beat Austria by 2-1 on Wednesday in St.-Denis, France, to advance from Group F. The reward will be a match against England in Nice on Monday.

PORTUGAL 3, HUNGARY 3 Cristiano Ronaldo came through for Portugal. Twice.
Erupting from his scoring slump, Ronaldo netted his first two goals of the tournament, becoming the first player to score at four straight European Championships.
Ronaldo's strikes, the first off a spectacular back heel and the second a header, helped Portugal earn a draw with Hungary in Lyon as both teams advanced from Group F and into the round of 16. (AP)
IRELAND 1, ITALY 0 Ireland advanced to the Euros' knockout stages for the first time, beating a shuffled Italian lineup in Lille.
An 85th-minute goal by Robbie Brady was enough for Ireland to advance from Group E. The Irish will face host France in Lyon on Sunday.
Italy, which was already assured of Group E's top spot, will meet Spain, the defending champion. (AP)
BELGIUM 1, SWEDEN 0 Zlatan Ibrahimovic played his last game for Sweden, a loss to Belgium in Nice. Belgium advanced to the round of 16, where it will play Hungary on Sunday in Toulouse. (AP)
