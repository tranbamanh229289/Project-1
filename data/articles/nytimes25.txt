The most serious charges against the violinist Stefan Arzberger, who had been accused of trying to strangle a fellow guest in a Midtown hotel, were dismissed Wednesday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Arzberger, who had faced a charge of attempted murder, instead pleaded guilty to a less serious charge of reckless assault in the third degree, and was given an unconditional discharge. He faces no jail time or fine.
The decision leaves Mr. Arzberger, a violinist for the Leipzig String Quartet whose passport was confiscated, free to return home to Germany after a 15-month ordeal.
Mr. Arzberger, 43, had been accused of barging naked into the room of a 64-year-old woman at the Hudson Hotel, where he was staying while on tour in March 2015, and trying to strangle her.
But his lawyers said he had been drugged by a prostitute who Mr. Arzberger had brought to his room earlier the same night and who they later learned was a man.
Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass told the court that his office had agreed to drop the most serious charges for a number of reasons including a lack of discernible motive for the alleged attack, and the wishes of the victim, who prosecutors said had not objected to the decision.
Mr. Arzberger, who lives in Germany, was forced to stay in the United States while the charges were pending. His lawyer, Nicholas Kaizer, could not say what his immediate plans were. Mr. Arzberger still faces a civil suit brought by the woman, Pamela Robinson, of Asheville, N.C.
In a statement, Mr. Arzberger's publicist said that the musician “is very pleased with the outcome of this case and looks forward to moving forward with his life.”
