Just for the Fourth of July, Yankee Red Hots sausages are being sold to take home from Pig Beach, a seasonal, mostly outdoor restaurant serving smoked meat overlooking the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. The links are made in-house from pork riddled with bits of provolone and pickled hot cherry peppers. The restaurant smokes them before grilling; home cooks should roast them at 250 degrees for 20 minutes, then brown them on the grill or in a skillet. As they cook, they ooze cheese: Yankee Red Hots, $20 for four to pick up at Pig Beach, 480 Union Street (Bond Street), Gowanus, Brooklyn, 718-737-7181, pigbeachnyc.com; to order in advance at info@pigbeachnyc.com.
