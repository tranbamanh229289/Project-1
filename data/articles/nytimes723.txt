ATHENS â€” Three people were killed and two were wounded Thursday during a shootout in Cyprus in the southeastern tourist resort town of Ayia Napa, the police said.
The police declined to speculate about what was behind the violence, but terrorism appeared to have been ruled out. The shooting may have been related to local criminal gangs.
State radio reported one more fatality than the police, saying that four people had been killed, including a local businessman.
Serious crime is rare in Cyprus, which attracts more than two million tourists each year, mainly from Western Europe. But there are sporadic episodes of gang violence.
In June 2012, five security guards were fatally shot in Ayia Napa, in what was widely considered a contract killing.
