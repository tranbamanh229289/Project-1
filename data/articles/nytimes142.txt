NEW HAVEN â€” Three men have been arrested amid an investigation into what caused 17 people in and around this city to overdose last week, three fatally and four who remain hospitalized, officials said on Tuesday.
Initial testing of the drugs involved in the overdoses indicated that the victims had consumed pure fentanyl, a powerful opioid painkiller, when they thought they were taking cocaine, officials said.
All of the overdoses happened on Thursday, and officials here declared a public health emergency the next day.
The three men arrested on federal drug charges were Frank Pina, 57; Jerome Clay Sr., 55; and Steven Whaley, 48. The three, all of whom are from New Haven, had supplied drugs to at least 12 of the people who overdosed, including at least two of those who died, federal and New Haven authorities said.
A public defender for Mr. Pina declined to comment. Mr. Clay's lawyer, Robert Golger, said his client maintained his innocence. A lawyer for Mr. Whaley did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
