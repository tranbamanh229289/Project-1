On the first Saturday of every month, residents of the Soundview section of the Bronx know where to go for a dose of body-slamming, eye-gouging, family-oriented mayhem: Daro's Extreme Fitness, a gym where people don tights, boots and, often, handmade leather masks to do battle as part of the Bronx Wrestling Federation. Chairs will be swung. Garbage cans will be tossed. Muscles will be flexed. Children will be entertained. And on the right night, Fred R. Conrad, a longtime photographer for The New York Times, will capture it all on film.
Minor wrestling circuits operate all over the country, drawing loyal crowds and stoking hopes that one of the performers will someday reach the big time. Started by Francisco Segundo, 53, an owner of the gym who wrestles as Bronco Internacional, the Bronx federation is a Pan-American affair. Many of the wrestlers grapple in the colorful lucha libre gear and acrobatic style popularized in Mexico; others wear basic brawler attire. Either way, “it's a rough atmosphere,” said Jorel Arroyo, 35, who works at a T-Mobile store and wrestles as the King of New York. On June 4, he became the United States champion of the Bronx Wrestling Federation, which sounds like title inflation only to those who don't understand pro wrestling. He is also head trainer at the gym's school for wrestlers. “We have police officers, drug dealers, mailmen, teachers,” he said. “I started out as an actor. I was going to audition for Juilliard after high school, but I decided to go for professional wrestling.”
At the end of the night, Mr. Segundo lets children in the crowd storm the ring to interact with the wrestlers. Then the real chaos happens. And on a good night, nobody gets hurt.
