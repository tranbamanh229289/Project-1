Poland had spent time preparing for a penalty shootout and it showed.
The team qualified for the quarterfinals of the European Championships for the first time by converting all of its penalty kicks to beat Switzerland in a shootout, 5-4, on Saturday in St.-Étienne, France.
After a 1-1 draw that Switzerland dominated for long periods, Grzegorz Krychowiak stepped up to score the shootout winner.
Poland will play Portugal in the quarterfinals on Thursday in Marseille, its best performance in a major competition since reaching the semifinals of the 1982 World Cup.
Krychowiak's winning penalty kick capped an impressive display by Poland's players during the shootout. The only player to miss was Switzerland midfielder Granit Xhaka, whose shot went wide left.
“Preparing for this match, we tried to improve our penalties, and we knew they'd be taken in the best possible way,” Poland Coach Adam Nawalka said through an interpreter.
Jakub Blaszczykowski scored his second goal of the tournament to give Poland the lead in the 39th minute with a low shot past Swiss goalkeeper Yann Sommer.
