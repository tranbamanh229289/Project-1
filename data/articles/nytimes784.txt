What is Mr. Rosenthal mad about this week? Congress, again, he says. “The United States Senate on Monday voted down two of the most mindlessly simple and obvious and necessary gun control measures,” he says. Why? “Frozen blind partisanship in the Senate” and the power of the National Rifle Association.” (In passing, Mr. Rosenthal mentions that he was once a member of the N.R.A.: “I actually like guns. They make a great noise and they smell good when you shoot them.”)
The worst news this week, according to Mr. Rosenthal, comes from Europe: “The European Union is once again gasping for breath,” he says. In Mr. Rosenthal's view, the division over Britain's membership in the bloc “underscores the fundamental, original problem with the European Union: They attempted to have economic unity without political unity, and it's impossible.”
The good news this week? Easy, says Mr. Rosenthal: The Trump campaign has relatively little money compared to Hillary Clinton's campaign. “That's a really good thing.”
Summer bonus: Mr. Rosenthal's nomination for the “Who cares?” news of the week.“Ted Cruz has endorsed Marco Rubio for re-election,” he says. “Two of the most irrelevant people who have ever set foot on the national political stage are hand in hand, walking off into the sunset, and it ain't Humphrey Bogart and Claude Raines.”
Susan Lehman is host.
