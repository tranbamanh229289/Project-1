The comedian Lewis Black will perform four nights of stand-up at the Marquis Theater on Broadway this fall at the peak of election season.
The curmudgeonly Mr. Black, who is a longstanding contributor to “The Daily Show” and gave voice to Anger in the movie “Inside Out,” last performed on Broadway during the 2012 election cycle. In a review of that show for The New York Times, Charles Isherwood described Mr. Black as being in “fine, sputtering form, exuding an air of exhausted disgust at the state of the country and the state of the world that will surely resonate with audiences feeling similarly grim as the grinding last stages of the presidential election loom.”
Mr. Black will no doubt approach this singular election with similar rancor. “I can't wait to get mad about the madness,” he said in a statement about the show, “Lewis Black: Black to the Future.”
Performances will take place on four Mondays — Sept. 12, 19, 26 and Oct. 10, at 8 p.m. — dark days for the Broadway musical “On Your Feet!,” which calls the Marquis Theater home. Tickets will go on sale on Monday, June 27, at 10 a.m. at Ticketmaster.com.
