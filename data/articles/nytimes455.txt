Mrs. Gregg, 30, is known as Merrill. She is the director for planned giving at the Texas Parks and Wildlife Foundation, a conservation organization in Dallas. She graduated cum laude from Princeton.
Her father retired as a partner in the Washington law firm Covington & Burling. He is now an overseer of the Society of the Cincinnati's American Revolution Institute, in Washington. Her mother is an interior designer in Delaplane.
Mr. Gregg, 32, is the chief financial officer of Double Eagle Energy Holdings II, an oil exploration and production company in Fort Worth. He graduated from Dartmouth and received an M.B.A. from Harvard.
His father, a former Republican governor of New Hampshire, retired after having been a United States senator from New Hampshire from 1993 to 2011. The groom's grandfather, the late Hugh Gregg, was also a New Hampshire governor, from 1953-1955.
The couple knew each other as elementary students at the Potomac School in McLean, Va., and reconnected in 2012 in Hong Kong, where Ms. Chester was then working, at a New Year's Eve dinner that followed a wedding Mr. Gregg had attended.
