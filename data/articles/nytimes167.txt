Officials were working to locate and rescue three Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway employees after two freight trains collided in the Panhandle of Texas, causing a black smoke cloud so noxious that residents from a nearby town were forced to evacuate.
According to a statement from the railroad, the lead locomotives on the two trains collided near Panhandle, Tex., around 8:40 a.m. Tuesday. Rescuers quickly located one employee, who was sent to a hospital for treatment, but officials were still working to locate and rescue the other three.
Photos of the incident showed a black smoke cloud rising into the sky, and flames engulfing a pile of burning train cars.
Joseph Faust, the director of public affairs for BNSF Railway, said it was unclear why the trains were on the same track. He described the situation as “fluid.” In an email, he said that a full investigation was under way to determine the cause of the incident.
In addition to evacuations, residents of Panhandle were also asked to cut back on their water use as crews worked to put out fires caused by the wreck, according to Roni Willburn, the city secretary.
The town of Panhandle sees frequent train traffic — about one train every 15 minutes, according to Ms. Willburn. The area is about 25 miles northeast of Amarillo and five hours north of Fort Worth, where BNSF Railway is headquartered.
