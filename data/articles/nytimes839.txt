INTERNATIONAL
An article on May 24 about Asian nations' skepticism about how much they can rely on Washington's commitment and staying power in Asia, despite President Obama's “pivot” there, misspelled, in some editions, the name of the Vietnamese deepwater port that the United States hopes to gain access to. It is Cam Ranh Bay, not Cam Rahn or Camh Rahn.
BUSINESS DAY
An article on the DealBook page on June 1 about the growing phenomenon of virtual shareholders' meetings erroneously attributed a distinction to Intel. While it was the first company to permit online voting at a shareholders' meeting, in 2009, it was not the first to hold a virtual meeting.

An article on Wednesday about the abrupt departure of Nikesh Arora, who was in line to be chief executive of the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, referred incorrectly in some editions to the Chinese company Alibaba's main line of business. It is e-commerce, not search.
OBITUARIES
An obituary on Friday about the former Federal Bureau of Investigation official Kenneth Walton referred incorrectly to his departure from the F.B.I. in 1989. He retired; he did not resign.

An obituary on Wednesday about the Romanian general Victor Stanculescu misstated the location of Saftica, where he died. It is in southern Romania, near Bucharest — not in northern Roma.
