HONG KONG — Britain's voting to leave the European Union on Friday has sent markets, currency and other key pieces of the global economy on a wild ride.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index is now down more than 7 percent after briefly recovering amid news that the vote to remain in the E.U. was gaining ground. The British pound fell from $1.50 to $1.36, an uprecedented drop in such a short period.
Earlier on Thursday, American markets had shrugged off concerns about the possibility of Britain's leaving the E.U., but the early results were more positive for the “remain” side.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index has fallen about 4.7 percent, with stocks in British banks taking a particular beating: HSBC has dropped more than 8 percent, while Standard Chartered is down just more than 9 percent. The markets in Shanghai are down more than 1 percent.
“I would say your real money investors, someone wanting to get hold of pounds for business reasons, would not be participating in the markets today because of the volatility,” said Kymberly Martin, a senior market strategist at BNZ Markets. “The volumes trading are quite small and contributing to the large moves that are happening.”
But Ms. Martin said the pound could fall even further than it already has.
The Vix index of volatility shot up early on Friday in Asia, and is up about 15.5 percent.
FTSE 100 index futures have plunged again and are down more than 5 percent, indicating that London blue-chip stocks will open much lower on Friday. Gold, a haven asset, is up almost 2 percent.
