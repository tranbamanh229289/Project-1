The undeniable practicality of plastic glassware for outdoors is combined with attractive design in these glasses from Pubware. There's a stemless wine glass, heavy in the hand and thin at the drinking edge, while still thick enough to insulate so the ros√© stays cool. The same thoughtful design applies to the 16-ounce beer glass, as well as a 20-ounce version, a rocks glass and a cordial. All are dishwasher-safe and BPA-free, and claim resistance to clouding and cracking: Pubware, $24.99 to $54.99 for four glasses, $17.99 each with monogram or other lettering, pubware.com.
