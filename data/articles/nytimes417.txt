Will the quality of mercy prove unstrained enough to embrace a work in which every single character is “racist and sexist”? That assessment of the dramatis personae in “The Merchant of Venice” comes from Tina Packer, who is directing the most problematic of the so-called “problem plays” for Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, Mass. As the founder of this venerable outpost of bardolatory in the Berkshires and for many years its artistic director, Ms. Packer has long been celebrated for her untiringly exploratory approach to the canon.
For “Merchant,” which begins performances at the Tina Packer Playhouse on Friday, July 1, she reconceives a play she staged for the troupe in 1998, with the same actor, Jonathan Epstein, playing the much-maligned usurer Shylock. They will be joined by a multiethnic international cast in uncovering what's news on the Rialto. (Through Aug. 21; 413-637-3353, shakespeare.org.)
