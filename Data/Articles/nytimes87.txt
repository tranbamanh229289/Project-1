Banks and other financial companies led another broad surge in United States stocks on Wednesday, turning the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slightly positive for the year.
It was a second day of gains for the market, which had been rattled since Friday by investor concerns over Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
Those worries appeared to ease on Wednesday. The advance made over Tuesday and Wednesday erased more than half of the losses the American market absorbed in the two-day slide that started on Friday.
Britain's stock market has recouped all its losses in the same stretch, but other major markets in Europe and Asia have yet to bounce back.
“The worries around Brexit are now moving from short-term worries to long-term worries, and that's why we're seeing this dramatic rebound in the market,” said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank.
The S.&P. 500 index rose 34.68 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,070. The Nasdaq composite added 87.38 points, or 1.9 percent, to 4,779.25. The Dow gained 284.96 points, or 1.6 percent, to 17,694.68.
The VIX, a gauge of expectation of future stock volatility, fell 11.3 percent on Wednesday to 16.6. It had hit 25.8 on Friday.
“The VIX is literally where it was two weeks ago,” said Tom Siomades, head of Hartford Funds' Investment Consulting Group. He said that it appeared investors had realized “it's going to take a long time to unwind this thing.”
Britain's benchmark stock index, the FTSE 100, gained 3.6 percent, while the DAX in Germany rose 1.8 percent. The CAC 40 in France added 2.6 percent.
Earlier, stock markets in Asia closed broadly higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1.6 percent and the South Korean Kospi gained 1 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index added 1.3 percent, while the Australian S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.8 percent. Stocks in Taiwan, Singapore and Indonesia also were higher.
In currency markets, the British pound recovered some of its losses this week but remained near its 31-year low. It rose to $1.3452 from $1.3343 on Tuesday.
The yen, which strengthened sharply after the British referendum, bounced back after an early slide. The dollar fell to 102.56 yen from 102.79 yen. The euro rose to $1.1124 from $1.1049.
On Wall Street, financial companies, which had taken the brunt of the selling after the British leave vote, rose 2.3 percent. The sector is still down 5.6 percent for the year.
Citigroup jumped 4.2 percent, adding $1.68 to $42.12, while American Express rose $2.02, or 3.5 percent, to $59.63. JPMorgan Chase gained $1.68, or 2.8 percent, to $61.20.
Several oil and gas production and transportation companies also notched gains as the price of crude oil rose sharply. Murphy Oil climbed $1.93, or 6.4 percent, to $32.01. Kinder Morgan rose 82 cents, or 4.6 percent, to $18.53.
The market also got a boost from new data on consumer spending and the latest batch of company deal news.
The Commerce Department said that consumer spending increased 0.4 percent in May on top of a 1.1 percent surge in April. The data underscores that consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of United States economic activity, picked up in the spring after getting off to a slow start in 2016.
The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce agreed to buy bank holding company PrivateBancorp for $47 a share in cash and stock, or $3.73 billion. News of the deal sent PrivateBancorp shares up 23.3 percent. The stock added $8.36 to $44.29.
Tesaro more than doubled after the drug developer said its targeted pill for recurrent ovarian cancer prevented the disease from worsening for many months after chemotherapy ended. There is no approved maintenance treatment to keep ovarian cancer at bay after chemotherapy. The stock gained $40.19, to $77.40.
In energy futures trading, benchmark American crude surged $2.03, or 4.2 percent, to close at $49.88 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, also rose $2.03, or 4.2 percent, to close at $50.61 a barrel in London.
Among metals, gold rose $9, to $1,326.90 an ounce. Silver gained 52 cents, to $18.41 an ounce, and copper added 1 cent, to $2.19 a pound.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 1.51 percent from 1.47 percent.
