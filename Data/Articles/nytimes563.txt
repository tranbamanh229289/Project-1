You may call it whatever you like, but your gross tongue is still involved. Everyone should have the right to refuse to share food, especially an ice cream cone, because of its deep saliva involvement and frank sensuality. What’s more, you are not teaching him to share; you are teaching him to be paranoid of confiscatory taxation by a predatory daddy state that takes what it wants under cover of fancy French terms. He’ll become a reactionary. I find in your son’s favor, with the proviso that all food abandoned by children is not only fair game for dads but also magically calorie-free.
