Maxwell L. Anderson, a longtime museum leader who left the Dallas Museum of Art last year after four years as its director, will become the president of the Souls Grown Deep Foundation in Atlanta, which preserves and promotes works by self-taught African-American artists, primarily in the South.
The nonprofit foundation, which gave a major gift of works to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2014, grew out of the collecting and scholarship of William S. Arnett, and has been run by members of the Arnett family. The partial handing of the reins to Mr. Anderson — his title is a newly created position — signals the foundation’s increasing momentum in working to place its extensive holdings in important public collections.
In an interview, Mr. Anderson, who has followed the work of Mr. Arnett for decades, said: “Our premise now is providing more major institutions — and then smaller institutions — with works that will allow them to be able to tell the story of these artists and these traditions, which were, if not suppressed, then almost unknown for so long — comparable to the work of many jazz and blues artists for more than a generation.” The foundation’s collection holds important pieces by artists like Thornton Dial, Lonnie Holley, Nellie Mae Rowe, Joe Minter and the quiltmakers of Gee’s Bend in Alabama, whose place in the history of late 20th century art has become much more recognized in recent years.
Mr. Anderson will direct the foundation’s operations along with his current job, as executive director of the New Cities Foundation, a nonprofit urban think tank. Harry Arnett, one of Mr. Arnett’s four sons, will become chairman of the foundation’s board, succeeding his brother, Paul, who will continue to serve as a trustee.
