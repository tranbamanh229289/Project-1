Among the many thousands of books and artifacts at the Center for Jewish History are cookbooks and manuscripts. A small but well-curated selection of them is on display. Bonnie Slotnick, who owns the vintage cookbook store in the East Village, will talk about the books June 29 in a lecture starting at 6 p.m. The cookbooks come from the collections of the five partner organizations of the Jewish history center, including the Yeshiva University Museum and the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research: “Nourishing Tradition: Jewish Cookbooks and the Stories They Tell” through Sept. 9, Center for Jewish History, 15 West 16th Street, 212-868-4444, cjh.org. Admission to the talk and a reception afterward is free with reservations, cjh.org/event/2895.
