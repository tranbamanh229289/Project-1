Good evening. Here’s the latest.
1. Britain voted to leave the European Union.
The outcome highlighted the power of anti-elite, populist and nationalist sentiment at a time of economic and cultural dislocation.
The value of the British pound plummeted as financial markets absorbed the news. Our live coverage is here.
_____
2. The Supreme Court, still missing a ninth justice, handed down two momentous decisions.
One was a 4-4 deadlock that kept President Obama’s signature immigration plan on ice, a blow to his hopes to shield millions from deportation.
The second upheld affirmative action in admissions at the University of Texas at Austin. Here’s a guide explaining both rulings.
_____
3. In Washington, a 25-hour Democrat sit-in in the House brought institutional disruption, a hallmark of national politics, to the heart of the legislature.
But it failed to persuade the Republican leadership to agree to vote on gun control measures. Speaker Paul Ryan dismissed it as “a publicity stunt.”
Before Congress recessed for a week, the Senate voted to keep a compromise gun control bill alive, but in procedural limbo.
_____
4. The fracas turned into a watershed moment.
Protesting Democrats reached out to constituents on social media after Mr. Ryan adjourned the session, cutting off C-Span’s video feed.
C-Span pivoted, picking up the live video the representatives were shooting on Periscope, Facebook Live and the like.
“For one day and night,” our TV critic writes, “the hottest drama on cable was on C-Span.”
_____
5. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both weighed in on the Supreme Court’s immigration ruling. He praised it and she called it “heartbreaking.”
Mr. Trump was in Scotland, taking a campaign break that some strategists called ill-advised to attend the reopening of one of his golf courses.
The campaign manager he fired this week, Corey Lewandowski, joined CNN as a political commentator.
_____
6. “Stairway to Heaven” is safe — or rather the pockets of Jimmy Page and Robert Plant will not be emptied of millions of dollars.
A jury in Los Angeles ruled that Led Zeppelin did not steal the opening riff from a 1968 song by a band it crossed paths with early in its career.
“I didn’t remember it then, and I don’t remember it now,” Mr. Plant testified.
_____
7. The Justice Department made a major move against mass incarceration, a phenomenon that has deepened tensions in the national debate over racial inequities, law enforcement and justice.
A landmark agreement in Mississippi means that, for the first time, a local government must provide services to shrink jailings.
Those include diversion programs, re-entry services and barring incarceration for some failures to pay court-ordered fines.
_____
8. In Baltimore, protesters chanted “Freddie Gray should be here with us today” after a police officer was acquitted of all charges in Mr. Gray’s death.
The officer, Caesar Goodson, above, drove the van in which Mr. Gray suffered a fatal spinal injury.
The judge said prosecutors had not proved that Mr. Goodson had given or intended to give Mr. Gray a “rough ride,” making it the third trial in the case to end without a conviction.

9. Summer trip coming? Our Personal Tech columnist came up with a shortlist of devices worth taking on vacation (and a long list of things you can leave behind).
Sure, a small tablet for the plane, but you might consider Roku’s new Streaming Stick, to expand your hotel’s entertainment options, and a handy four-port USB wall charger.
_____
10. Sheryl Sandberg added a new element to her campaign against cultural themes she finds damaging to women.
She and her collaborator, Adam Grant, assert in one of our best-read pieces today that women help one another in life and work and that the idea of the catty woman or selfish “queen bee” is a myth.
“What’s the derogatory male equivalent?” they ask. “It doesn’t exist.”
_____
11. Finally, forget the birds and the bees. Check out the coral.
Scientists aiming to help the world’s struggling reefs are studying how entire reefs engage in what our science reporter describes as “primordial rites of mass spawning.”
Triggered by the moon and seasonal temperatures, the masses of tiny creatures that make up a reef release trillions of eggs and sperm simultaneously, a frenzy of fertility.
