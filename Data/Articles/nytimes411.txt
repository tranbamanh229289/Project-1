The work of the singer-songwriter Bill Callahan has become intensified with purpose over the last 10 years; the songs on “Dream River,” his last studio album, from 2013, can seem as if they were constructed one word at a time, one sound at a time, to be sung in his soft, abstracted baritone voice. Yet, weirdly, the songs aren’t stiff; they’re light-bodied and place trust in the universe. (“I have learned,” he sang in the last lines of “Winter Road,” that record’s final song, “when things are beautiful/to just keep on.”)
He will perform for three nights at Baby’s All Right in Brooklyn on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, June 26-28. (Sold out, but tickets may be available at the door; babysallright.com.)
