A cocktail at the Ritz Paris is more compelling than ever. A renovation has given the hotel three bars instead of two. First choice is still the wood-paneled memorabilia-filled Bar Hemingway in the back. There, Colin Field mixes drinks like the Mach2, four parts Scotch and two parts green Chartreuse with a good splash of ginger syrup, served on the rocks and light and refreshing enough for summer. Opposite is the new Ritz Bar, bistro-style with food all day and a deep wine list. And then there is Bar Vendôme, steps from the hotel’s main entrance and a magnet for fashionistas: Ritz Paris, 15, place Vendôme, Paris, 011-33-1-43-16-30-30.
