A monthlong celebration of the work of the choreographer William Forsythe will be hosted by the University of Southern California’s Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, the Music Center and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, from Sept. 29 to Oct. 23.
Called “Fall for Forsythe,” the events include “Focus Forsythe: The Choreographer’s Process,” in which Mr. Forsythe — who took on the role of professor of dance at the Glorya Kaufman School after stepping down from directing his own troupe — will show his creative process with students, and discuss it with Jill Johnson and Christopher Roman, two former dancers with his companies.
Two installation works by Mr. Forsythe, who has long created choreographic pieces for museum and site-specific settings in addition to formal theatrical pieces, will be shown at the Los Angeles County Museum.
Mr. Forsythe, whose “Blake Works 1” is to have its premiere at the Paris Opera Ballet on Monday, July 4, has long been recognized as one of the important figures working in dance today. His influence has extended into the fields of lighting and costumes, explored in “Forsythe Designed: A Costume Exhibition,” presented by the Music Center.
The Center will also host a final event at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion: three companies performing three important Forsythe ballets. The Houston Ballet will show “Artifact Suite” (2004); Pacific Northwest Ballet will dance “The Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude” (1996); and San Francisco Ballet will perform “Pas/Parts 2016,” recently reworked for that company.
