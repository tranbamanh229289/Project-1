Even during a relatively sleepy week on New York's classical calendar, there are tantalizing performances. On Sunday, June 26, the violinist Johnny Gandelsman and the pianist Ethan Iverson come together for Brahms's three sonatas at Bargemusic, a cozy spot for chamber music. (4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, bargemusic.org.)
Taka Kigawa, a coolly commanding pianist with a specialty in new music, plays a free show at Manhattan Inn in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, on Monday, with the cellist Justin Kantor, under the auspices of Le Poisson Rouge. (9 p.m., 632 Manhattan Avenue, lpr.com.) And this is your last chance to catch up with John Zorn's bagatelles, short pieces fleshed out by their interpreters; at the Stone on Sunday it will be the violinists Mark Feldman and Chris Otto. A selection of the bagatelles has been performed each Sunday afternoon at the Stone for a year, and this is the final matinee. (3 p.m., thestonenyc.com.)
