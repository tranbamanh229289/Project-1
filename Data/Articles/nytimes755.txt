In Nicolas Winding Refn’s dark drama “The Neon Demon,” a young woman (Elle Fanning) has dreams of becoming a model in the cutthroat fashion world in Los Angeles. In a recent interview, Mr. Refn discussed this scene featuring Ms. Fanning, Abbey Lee as a competitive model and Alessandro Nivola as a fashion designer. Here are edited excerpts from that discussion.
:10 This is a scene in “The Neon Demon” where we introduce Elle Fanning’s character at her first casting session. She’s on her road map to become a supermodel and she’s been at a photo studio. Now she’s getting into the world of catwalk.
:30 The idea of shooting this scene all in underwear is that it makes everything pure meat. And the idea is that you’re disposable and you’re degraded and you’re kind of looked upon as nothing but a prop.
1:30 I like to keep things in wide shot as much as possible because it tells the story very specifically. It’s almost a tableau structure. So every time there’s a new shot, there’s a new story going on within it.
2:30 I only kept Elle in close-ups because I wanted as much as possible to play on the imagination of what she would look like. The idea of beauty is difficult because it’s in the eye of the beholder. I always had to keep a sense of a hidden beauty, an illusion, that people essentially make up their own interpretation of what she may or may not look like. I give her very little dialogue and I keep her past very mysterious. On one level you can say she’s deer-in-the-headlights innocent. And the other time, she can be an evil Dorothy coming to the city to corrupt everyone.
3:40 With this interaction here, you show the dynamic between the three people and something that is essentially very campy and melodramatic will soon become very dangerous to Elle Fanning.
