How does The New York Times Book Review handle the delicate business of reviewing books by Times staff members?
“People think, ‘Oh, this is a Times writer's book, of course it's going to get a good review,' ” says Pamela Paul, the editor of the Book Review. “That is not the case.”
In this podcast, Ms. Paul describes the extra measures she takes to ensure that the Book Review provides objective reviews, not assessments motivated by personal connection or animus.
Ever been married to an author from The Times? Blurbed one of their books? Served on a panel with them? Sorry, you can't review that person's book for the Book Review.
Ms. Paul talks about the sticky situations that result when the Book Review runs less-than-glowing reviews of books by authors from The Times — and about how the negative Times review she got for her second book (which was published before she began her current job) informs her thinking about book reviews.
Susan Lehman is host.
