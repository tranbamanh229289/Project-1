The vision behind this collection of Nordic-accented food stands in the stately landmark Vanderbilt Hall at Grand Central Terminal belongs to Claus Meyer, the Danish food entrepreneur, a partner in Noma who is juggling several projects in New York. As a food hall, not a market, it is all about prepared food to eat in or take out. The bakery stand, Meyers Bageri, has breads, pastries, sandwiches and whole grain flatbreads with various toppings including richly burnished cauliflower. Open Rye specializes in smorrebrod open-faced sandwiches and the Grain Bar starts the day with granolas, then segues into a beer bar after 4 p.m. Almanak specializes in salads and smoothies and will soon offer small plates. A seating area with waiter service is adjacent, as is a liquor bar: The Great Northern Food Hall, Vanderbilt Hall, Grand Central Terminal, greatnorthernfood.com.
