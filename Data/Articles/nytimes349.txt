A superb performance by Eden Hazard guided Belgium to a 4-0 victory over Hungary in Toulouse, France, and a place in the quarterfinals at the European Championships.
Defender Toby Alderweireld opened the scoring with a header in the 10th minute after poor marking by the Hungary defense. But Belgium had to wait until the closing stages of the game to secure a convincing victory behind Hazard at the Stadium de Toulouse.
Hazard surged past a group of Hungary defenders on the left side before supplying a perfect low cross for Michy Batshuayi to steer home in the 78th minute, just two minutes after Batshuayi had entered the game.
Hazard followed up almost immediately with a spectacular goal, breaking down the left on another counterattack before cutting inside, skipping past three Hungary defenders and curling a shot into the bottom-right corner.
Yannick Ferreira Carrasco scored the fourth goal in stoppage time as Belgium set up a meeting with Wales.
Belgium stretched Hungary's defense on numerous occasions with its creative attacking play, with Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne pulling the strings. De Bruyne hit the crossbar with a free kick in the 35th minute and was denied several times by goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly.
Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois nearly gifted Hungary a goal when he slipped while trying to control a back pass in the first half. Luckily for Courtois, the ball trickled out for a corner kick.
