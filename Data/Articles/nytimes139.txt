OMAHA — In the warm-down area before his 200-meter butterfly semifinal on Tuesday, Michael Phelps spotted a trend. It has been out with the old and in with the new at these Olympic trials. In eight of the first 10 finals, the winner has been a first-time Olympian.
Phelps, who turns 31 on Thursday, was the oldest competitor in the 200 butterfly, and he carried the old guard by posting the fastest time in the semifinals. His time of 1 minute 55.17 seconds gave him a comfortable margin over Pace Clark (1:56.27) and Tom Shields (1:56.35) heading into Wednesday’s final. A two-time gold medalist in the event, Phelps owns the four fastest swims in its history, with times ranging from 1:51.51 to 1:52.20.
“My stroke didn’t feel that good,” Phelps said. “Honestly, I didn’t feel that good in the whole race.”
He felt better than many of his national team members. Missy Franklin and Matt Grevers, the reigning Olympic gold medalists in the women’s and men’s 100-meter backstrokes, both failed to make the team in those events.
The average age of the four winners Tuesday – Townley Haas in the men’s 200 freestyle, Olivia Smoliga in the women’s 100 backstroke, Ryan Murphy in the men’s 100 backstroke and Lilly King in the women’s 100 breaststroke — was 19.8.
“I was like, ‘I see a lot of new faces on this team,’” Phelps said. He added: “I think it’s interesting and also exciting just to have new faces, people who are really pumped to come up in the sport. I think that’s something that for me is a good thing to see as I’m on my way out.”
