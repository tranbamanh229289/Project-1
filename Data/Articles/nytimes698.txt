The elegance of the working man has affected artists for decades — from Ben Shahn’s social-realist paintings to Irving Penn’s fascination with tradespeople. And on the men’s spring/summer 2017 runways, designers have shown variations on neutral-toned uniforms. In Milan, Moncler Gamme Bleu presented field and safari jackets with boy-scout-style neckerchiefs in monochromatic earth tones, as Diesel Black Gold played with proportions, pairing fitted tops with baggy, voluminous pants. And in Paris, Lemaire showed a more understated take on utilitarianism, with light cotton gilets and work shirts coupled with pants that were belted at the waist and ankle.
