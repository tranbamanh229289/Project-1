Confusing gearshifts are a growing problem for Fiat Chrysler.
The company’s Maserati unit said on Thursday that it would recall more than 13,000 cars because of the same rollaway danger that set off the recall of 1.1 million Jeep and Chrysler models. A confusing electronic gearshift in those cars could mislead the driver into thinking the vehicle was safely in park.
And a class-action lawsuit was filed on Thursday accusing Fiat Chrysler of concealing a safety defect. The suit, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of owners of three 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokees in California, Florida and Ohio, asserts the gear shift design was “dangerously defective.”
Scrutiny of the Fiat Chrysler shifters, used in the 2014 and 2015 models of some of its most popular vehicles, has intensified after the death on Sunday of the actor Anton Yelchin, crushed when his Jeep Grand Cherokee rolled backward down his driveway.
The German supplier ZF, which made the parts for Fiat Chrysler, also manufactured the shifter and eight-speed transmission for Maserati’s recalled 2014 Quattroporte and Ghibli models. And Maserati said it was exploring remedies like a software fix.
Maserati said it had no reports of rollaways in the models, but it was recalling the vehicles at the insistence of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, according to a report from Maserati posted on the agency’s website.
A spokesman for ZF could not immediately be reached for comment.
On Wednesday, Fiat Chrysler said that it had come up with a repair for its 2014-15 Jeep Grand Cherokees and 2012-14 Chrysler 300 and Dodge Charger models and that owners could begin contacting dealers for appointments to fix the issue. The Grand Cherokee that struck Mr. Yelchin, 27, a “Star Trek” actor, was among the recalled models.
The remedy involves a software change so that the transmission will automatically shift into park if the driver’s door opens and the transmission is in drive or neutral.
The repair came much sooner than originally expected. When Fiat Chrysler announced the recall in April, it said it hoped to have a solution before the fourth quarter.
In its report, Maserati said the safety agency contacted it in February asking whether any of its vehicles used the ZF Monostable transmission. That was about the time the agency announced it was intensifying its investigation into the gearshift problem on the Fiat Chrysler models.
The highway safety agency also checked with other automakers about whether they used similar shifters from ZF. Those that did had added an auto-park feature, which prevents the same safety issue that has plagued the Fiat Chrysler vehicles, said Bryan Thomas, an agency spokesman.
