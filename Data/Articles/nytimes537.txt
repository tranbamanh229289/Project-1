The tallest tower in the Western Hemisphere, 432 Park Avenue, continues to fill up, with the official closings of two more luxury aeries, which were the most expensive transactions of the week, according to city records.
The pricier of the two sponsor units, at $24,990,100.31, was No. 66A, which is 837 feet up the 1,396-foot, 96-story concrete-and-glass building on “Billionaires' Row,” between 56th and 57th Streets. Its monthly carrying costs are $15,986.
The 4,109-square-foot apartment has three bedrooms, four and a half baths and a library. It offers stellar views of Central Park, the East River and beyond, along with the Statue of Liberty, the World Trade Center and the Empire State Building.
Timothy Rothman of Compass brought the buyer, whose identity, like that of most other new owners in the building, was shielded by a limited liability company, 432 Park Avenue Ste 66A.
The other sold apartment was No. 40A, which closed at $20,870,583.26, with monthly carrying charges totaling $17,622.
The apartment, which also provides park, river and cityscape vistas, has 4,430 square feet, with four bedrooms and four and a half baths. The buyer was identified as 432 Park Unit 40A LLC.
All 104 residences at 432 Park feature 12.6-foot ceilings, 10-by-10-foot windows and private elevator landings. Residents also have access to 30,000 square feet of amenities, among them a screening room, a billiards room, a spa and a gym.
The super-tall building was designed by Rafael Viñoly Architects and developed by Macklowe Properties and the CIM Group. Macklowe Properties Sales and Douglas Elliman Development Marketing are handling sales for the building.
The week's other high-priced closed sales include two loftlike apartments at another fast-selling luxury complex: 150 Charles Street, the Witkoff Group's 91-unit brick and glass condominium in the West Village. The units there had sold out just a few weeks after sales opened about three years ago.
The latest official closings, according to property records, were No. 11B, a four-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath apartment that sold for $15,312,042.78, and No. 14A, which has four bedrooms and three and a half baths, and sold for $15,157,038.09.
No. 11B, with 3,395 square feet, has monthly carrying costs of $6,448, reflecting a tax abatement. Bruce Ehrmann of Douglas Elliman Real Estate represented the buyer, identified as the Riverside Trust.
No. 14A has $5,774 in monthly carrying costs and was purchased by the limited liability company Peninsula Interests. Mark Cohen of Brown Harris Stevens represented the buyer.
Raphael De Niro, Darren Sukenik, Madeline Hult Elghanayan and Peter Zaitzeff of Douglas Elliman were the selling brokers for both listings.
Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.
