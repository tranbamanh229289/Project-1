This weekend at Muji's Fifth Avenue flagship location in New York, the work of six Japanese artists — handmade objects, designed for everyday use — will be on view and for sale as the store's new Tatazumai collection. The show was curated by the wood-crafter Ryuji Mitani, and is in keeping with Muji's egalitarian design sensibility (in his words: “minimal, no logos!”). Five of the makers will be on site through Sunday to share their craft with shoppers. And earlier this week, they invited T to a preview of the collection, and out to dinner — for, of all things, Japanese food.
