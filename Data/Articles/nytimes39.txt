SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, put himself in charge of a new governing agency created during a meeting of his country's rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People's Assembly, on Wednesday.
The Assembly revised North Korea's Constitution to create what the state media called a Commission on State Affairs, with Mr. Kim as its chairman. It replaces the National Defense Commission, the most powerful governing organ under Mr. Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, who ruled North Korea until his death in 2011.
Mr. Kim's new title was the latest in a series of top leadership roles in the military, party and government that he has acquired to establish his one-man rule.
Before his death, Kim Jong-il ruled North Korea as chairman of the National Defense Commission. Although the commission was originally created to oversee military affairs, he used it as his primary governing agency under his “military first” policy, which focused on the development of nuclear weapons and promoted the priorities of the Korean People's Army in economic and other policy decisions.
Since taking power, Kim Jong-un has engineered a series of purges and filled the top posts in the party and military with loyalists, regaining influence over the military.
Compared with the military-oriented National Defense Commission, the newly created commission is broader, including key party and cabinet figures as members.
In the congress of the Workers' Party in May, Mr. Kim was appointed chairman, a new post created to replace the title of general secretary that his father had held when he was the party boss.
The congress also adopted as a key national strategy Mr. Kim's “byungjin” policy, which seeks economic development while continuing to expand the country's nuclear weapons and missile capacities.
