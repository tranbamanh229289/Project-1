The singer Judith Hill is on tour with a recently released, old-school funk and soul record, “Back in Time.” She's also in the news for another reason: She was one of the three passengers on the small private plane with Prince on April 15 after his final concerts in Atlanta, six days before his death. During that plane ride — as she told our guest, the reporter Melena Ryzik, in a New York Times report this week — she saw Prince lose consciousness. The plane made an emergency landing and he was rushed to the hospital.
For those looking to understand more about Prince's musical life in his final years, Ms. Hill's larger story is illuminating. His contributions to “Back in Time” run deep, and Ms. Ryzik explains how close their musical connection was: Ms. Hill's parents, both musicians, had played with some of Prince's idols. The story — and this Popcast — explains how Prince had been helping Ms. Hill develop to a new stage of her career, from a backup singer with Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, a contestant on NBC's “The Voice,” and one of the singers featured prominently in Morgan Neville's 2013 documentary “20 Feet From Stardom” (for which she won a Grammy Award), to a self-determining independent artist.
